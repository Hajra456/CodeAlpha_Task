**Introduction:**
Network sniffers are tools used to monitor and analyze network traffic. This project aims to create a basic network sniffer using Python, which can capture and display network packets in real-time.The sniffer is designed to work on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, and it provides a simple command-line interface for users to interact with.


**Features:**
Capture and display network packets in real-time.
Filter packets by protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
Display packet details, including source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, and payload.
Save captured packets to a file for later analysis.


**Usage:**
The sniffer will start capturing network packets and display them in the console.
You can filter the packets by protocol by using the -p or --protocol flag, followed by the protocol name (e.g., tcp, udp, icmp).
To save the captured packets to a file, use the -o or --output flag, followed by the file name (e.g., python sniffer.py -o captured_packets.pcap).


**Conclusion:**
The network sniffer project provides a basic tool for monitoring and analyzing network traffic using Python. While it may not have the advanced features of commercial network analysis tools, it can still be a useful tool for network administrators, security professionals, and hobbyists who want to understand and troubleshoot network-related issues. By building upon this project, users can further enhance its functionality and tailor it to their specific needs.
